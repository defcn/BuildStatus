This is how the images look. You may edit them in any way.
```

[![reponame dualmode](https://github.com/defcn/BuildStatus/raw/master/moderate.png)](https://github.com/defcn/BuildStatus/blob/master/moderate.png)

```
You can also download the images and replace them here is the format if you want do that **YOU MUST HAVE THEM IN A REPO ON GITHUB or in your REPO**
Here is the format
```
[![reponame dualmode](https://github.com/githubusername/reponame/raw/branch/imgname.png)](#clickable[inside git repo])
[![reponame dualmode](https://github.com/githubusername/reponame/raw/branch/imgname.png)](http://www.google.com/ [leads to anything you put it in as a web link])
```
Paste the syntax from my repo or down the files and upload them to your own repo with the example above into your README.md and it should do good. Any bugs or assistance needed just post a issue report on GitHub.

# Notes
The clickable action that happens to your image can be removed it is not required. I would just recommend having it link to your README.md as a direct link.
**Example**
```
https://github.com/githubusername/reponame/blob/branch/README.md/
```
